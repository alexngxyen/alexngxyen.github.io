# About Me
I am a Ph.D. student at the University of California, Irvine (UCI) in the [Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering](https://engineering.uci.edu/dept/mae), where I work under the joint supervision of Prof. [Faryar Jabbari](https://engineering.uci.edu/users/faryar-jabbari) and Prof. [Magnus Egerstedt](https://engineering.uci.edu/users/magnus-egerstedt) in the Robot Ecology Laboratory. Broadly, my research interests lie in robotics, control theory, optimization, and state estimation with application to multi-robot systems, mobile sensor networks, and cyber-physical systems.

In June 2022, I received my M.S. in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering from UCI while working under the supervision of Prof. [Zak Kassas](https://engineering.osu.edu/people/kassas.2) in the [Autonomous Systems, Perception, Intelligence, and Navigation Laboratory](https://ece.osu.edu/aspin). My M.S. was focused on the performance analysis of aerial vehicle navigation and efficient transmitter selection strategies while using terrestrial signals of opportunity (SOPs). During my M.S., I also completed two internships in the [Autonomy Technology Research Center Summer Program](https://udayton.edu/engineering/departments/electrical_and_computer/faculty_activities/atr-center-summer-program/index.php) at the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in the Navigation and Communication (RYWN) branch investigating aerial vehicle navigation with cellular signals in the absence of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signals. 

Before joining UCI, I received my B.S. with Honors in Mechanical Engineering from the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) in June 2020. While at UCSB, I worked with Prof. [Enoch Yeung](https://engineering.ucsb.edu/people/enoch-yeung) on developing new methods for the synthesis of genetics circuits for nonlinear biological systems in the [Biological Control Laboratory](https://yeung.me.ucsb.edu/).

In my spare time, I enjoy bouldering, playing sports (especially, soccer!), hiking, camping, photography, and traveling.
