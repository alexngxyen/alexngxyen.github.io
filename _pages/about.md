# About Me
I am a Ph.D. student at the University of California, Irvine (UCI) in the [Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering](https://engineering.uci.edu/dept/mae), where I work under the joint supervision of Dr. [Magnus Egerstedt](https://engineering.uci.edu/users/magnus-egerstedt) and Dr. [Faryar Jabbari](https://engineering.uci.edu/users/faryar-jabbari) in the [Robot Ecology Laboratory](https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/robotecology/). My broad research interests lie in control theory, optimization, and state estimation with application to multi-robot systems, mobile sensor networks, and cyber-physical systems.

In June 2022, I received my M.S. in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering from UCI while working under the supervision of Dr. [Zak Kassas](https://engineering.osu.edu/people/kassas.2) in the [Autonomous Systems, Perception, Intelligence, and Navigation Laboratory](https://ece.osu.edu/aspin). My M.S. was focused on the performance analysis of aerial vehicle navigation and efficient transmitter selection strategies while using terrestrial signals of opportunity. During my M.S., I also completed two internships in the [Autonomy Technology Research Center Summer Program](https://udayton.edu/engineering/departments/electrical_and_computer/faculty_activities/atr-center-summer-program/index.php) at the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in the Navigation and Communication branch investigating long-duration aerial vehicle navigation -- in the absence of global navigation satellite system signals -- with cellular signals. 

Before attending UCI, I received my B.S. with Honors in Mechanical Engineering from the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) in June 2020. While at UCSB, I worked with Dr. [Enoch Yeung](https://engineering.ucsb.edu/people/enoch-yeung) on developing new methods for synthesizing genetics circuits for nonlinear biological systems using a data-driven approach in the [Biological Control Laboratory](https://yeung.me.ucsb.edu/).

Outside of academia, I enjoy rock climbing, soccer, traveling, hiking, camping, and photography.
