# About Me
I am a Ph.D. student at the University of California, Irvine (UCI) in the [department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering](https://engineering.uci.edu/dept/mae), where I work under the joint supervision of [Prof. Faryar Jabbari](https://engineering.uci.edu/users/faryar-jabbari) and [Prof. Magnus Egerstedt](https://engineering.uci.edu/users/magnus-egerstedt) in the Robot Ecology Laboratory. My research interests are broadly related to ecology-inspired robotics, control theory, and state estimation in network systems, in particular multi-robot systems, mobile sensor networks and cyber-physical systems.

In June 2022, I received my M.S. in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering from UCI while working under the supervision of [Prof. Zak Kassas](https://engineering.osu.edu/people/kassas.2) in the Autonomous Systems, Perception, Intelligence, and Navigation Laboratory. My M.S. was focused on aerial vehicle navigation performance analysis and efficient transmitter selection with cellular signals. During my M.S., I also completed two internships in the [Autonomy Technology Research Center Summer Program](https://udayton.edu/engineering/departments/electrical_and_computer/faculty_activities/atr-center-summer-program/index.php) at the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base within the Navigation and Communication (RYWN) branch, working on aerial vehicle navigation using cellular signals of opportunity (SOPs) in the absence of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signals. Prior to UCI, I received my B.S. with Honors in Mechanical Engineering from the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) in June 2020. While at UCSB, I worked with [Prof. Enoch Yeung](https://engineering.ucsb.edu/people/enoch-yeung) in the Biological Control, Computing, and Learning Laboratory on new methods for synthesis of genetics circuits for nonlinear biological systems.

Outside of academics, my hobbies include bouldering, hiking, camping, photography, and sports (specifically, soccer and tennis!).
