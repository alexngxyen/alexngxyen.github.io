I study the control of network systems with applications to multi-robot systems. Specifically, the applications I have focused on are: 1) Guaranteed Capture in Multi-Player Reach-Avoid Games, 2) Coverage Control and its Applications.

# Guaranteed Capture in Multi-Player Reach-Avoid Games

Reach-avoid games are a type of pursuit evasion game in which one player, the evader, tries to reach a goal set while actively avoiding other sets typically induced by the remaining players, called pursuers. The generalization of these dynamic games has applications ranging from safety in robotics to surveillance and defense. Previous work primarily considers games where the pursuers are faster than the evader, but my work has focused on the alternative problem of a faster evader. I am working on providing conditions on the number of pursuers necessary, the allowable heterogeneity, and the domain geometry necessary to guarantee capture of the evader.

# Coverage Control and its Applications

Coverage control aims to address the problem of resource allocation within a domain of interest. For arbitrary domains and regions of interest, finding globally optimal resource allocation configurations is an NP-hard problem. My work has focused on using tools from computational geometry and network systems theory to give sufficient conditions on the optimality of a configuration of agents. One application that I have focused on is the deployment of a team of lower-mobility aerial vehicles to persistently measure wind data in a wind farm for better characterization of wind turbine wakes.
