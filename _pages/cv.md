  * ***Advisors:*** Dr. Magnus Egerstedt and Dr. Faryar Jabbari
      * Leveraging ecological principles to understand why, when, and how it is beneficial for a heterogeneous multi-agent team to work together.
      * Built and programmed differential- and mecanum-wheeled robots with lab members (graduate and undergraduate students).
      * Gave lab tours, which included live demonstrations of mobile robots performing coordinated algorithms, to 70+ visitors.
      * Presented research findings at the SoCal Robotics 2023 workshop (in-person), IEEE CDC 2023 (in-person), and SoCal Control Spring 2024 Workshop (in-person) to 160+ attendees, including high school students, undergraduate students, graduate students, professors, and industry professionals.

* Multi-Robot Systems Laboratory (Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, Mexico), Visiting Researcher, Oct. 2023 - Nov. 2023
  * ***Advisor:*** Dr. Luis Guerrero-Bonilla
    * Designed a scalable architecture that allows for collaborative interaction to occur between large swarms comprised of heterogeneous robots.
    * Programmed mecanum-wheeled robots with lab members (graduate and undergraduate students).
    * Performed analysis and design for attaching a mechanical structure onto the Dingo-O robot.
    * Presented research findings at the Multi-Robot Systems Laboratory (in-person) to 10+ attendees, including undergraduate students, graduate students, and professors.
