## Research Experience
* [Robot Ecology Laboratory](https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/robotecology/) (Irvine, CA), Graduate Student Researcher, Sept. 2022 - Present
  * ***Advisors:*** Dr. Magnus Egerstedt and Dr. Faryar Jabbari
  *  Leverage ecological principles to understand why, when, and how it is beneficial for a heterogeneous multi-agent team to work together.
  *  Helped lab members to build and program differential- and mecanum-wheeled robots.
  *  Gave lab tours, which included live demonstrations of mobile robots performing coordinated algorithms, to 70+ visitors.
  *  Presented my research findings at the SoCal Robotics 2023 workshop (in-person), IEEE CDC 2023 (in-person), and SoCal Control Spring 2024 Workshop (in-person) to 160+ attendees, including high school students, undergraduate students, graduate students, professors, and industry professionals.

* Multi-Robot Systems Laboratory (Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, Mexico), Visiting Researcher, Oct. 2023 - Nov. 2023
  * ***Advisor:*** Dr. Luis Guerrero-Bonilla
  * Investigated using techniques from differential geometry and automata theory to capture the collaborative interactions in a heterogeneous robot team.
  * Assisted graduate and undergraduate students to program mecanum-wheeled robots.
  * Performed analysis and design for attaching a mechanical structure onto the Dingo-O robot.
  * Presented my research findings at the Multi-Robot Systems Laboratory (in-person) to 10+ attendees, including undergraduate students, graduate students, and professors.

* [Autonomous Systems, Perception, Intelligence, and Navigation Laboratory](https://ece.osu.edu/aspin) (Irvine, CA), Graduate Student Researcher, Sept. 2020 - June 2022
  * ***Advisor:*** Dr. Zak Kassas
  * Spearheaded the terrestrial-based opportunistic aerial vehicle navigation projects, which involved synthesizing efficient transmitter selection strategies and conducting performance analyses of an aerial vehicle navigating via cellular signals without access to global navigation satellite signals.
  * Helped to set the hardware requirements for the lab by specifying the necessary equipment to purchase for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) flight experiments.
  * Assisted other graduate students in preparing the UAV's software and hardware before flight experiments and processing the signals collected from cellular towers after flight experiments.
  * Presented my research findings at the ION GNSS+ 2021 (virtual and in-person) and ION ITM 2022 (virtual and in-person) to 100+ attendees, including graduate students, professors, military researchers, and industry professionals.
