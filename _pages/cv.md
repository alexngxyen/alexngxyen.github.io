* **M.S.** in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, University of California Irvine, June 2022
  * *Thesis:* Aerial Vehicle Navigation with Terrestrial Signals of Opportunity: Performance Analysis and Transmitter Selection  [[PDF]](https://alexngxyen.github.io/files/Alex_Nguyen_UCI_Masters_Thesis.pdf)
* **B.S. with Honors** in Mechanical Engineering, University of California Santa Barbara, June 2020
* **A.S. with Honors** in Mechanical Engineering, Diablo Valley College, May 2018

Research Experience
======
* Graduate Student Researcher, Robot Ecology Laboratory (Irvine, CA), Sept. 2022 - Present
  * *Advisors:* Prof. Faryar Jabbari and Prof. Magnus Egerstedt
  * Investigating the cooperative and collaborative control of heterogeneous multi-agent systems inspired by an ecological perspective.
  * Programming the homogeneous and heterogeneous robots contained within the robot ecology laboratory. 

* Graduate Student Researcher, [Autonomous Systems, Perception, Intelligence, and Navigation Laboratory](https://ece.osu.edu/aspin) (Irvine, CA), Sept. 2020 - June 2022
  * *Advisor:* Prof. Zak Kassas
  * Spearheaded the terrestrial-based opportunistic aerial vehicle navigation projects which involved synthesizing efficient transmitter selection strategies and conducting a performance analysis of an aerial vehicle navigating with cellular signals.
  * Regularly brainstormed solutions to estimation theory and navigation system problems with eight other student researchers. 
  * Helped set the hardware requirements for lab experiments and submitted purchase orders to obtain the necessary hardware.
  * Prepared the hardware and software for the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) flight experiments, as well as helped to analyze the collected cellular signal of opportunity (SOP) experimental data.
  * Compiled research findings into presentation slides shown at the ION GNSS+ 2021 (virtual and in-person) and ION ITM 2022 (virtual and in-person) conference venues which contained 100+ attendees (e.g., military researchers, industry professionals, professors, and graduate students).

* Undergraduate Research Assistant, [Biological Control, Computing, and Learning Laboratory](https://yeung.me.ucsb.edu/) (Santa Barbara, CA), Sept. 2019 - Mar. 2020
  * *Advisor:* Prof. Enoch Yeung
  * Researched new methods for synthesis of genetic circuits for nonlinear biological systems using a data-driven approach.
  * Collaborated with three graduate students and a junior research associate on their synthetic biology projects which involved preparing experiments and performing data collection.

Work Experience
======
* Electrical Engineering Intern, [Autonomy Technology Research Center Summer Program](https://udayton.edu/engineering/departments/electrical_and_computer/faculty_activities/atr-center-summer-program/index.php) (Dayton, OH), June 2021 - Sept. 2021 & <br/> June 2022 - Sept. 2022
  * *Mentors:* Mark Carroll and Mark Smearcheck
  * Created simulation environments in MATLAB and Python to study the estimation performance of the localization, mapping, and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) frameworks for aircraft navigation with cellular signals of opportunity (SOPs).
  * Processed cellular SOP data collected by a U.S. Air Force high-altitude aircraft during a flight campaign in Southern California.
  * Compared the estimation accuracy and computation speed of seven different stochastic filters (e.g., variations of the Kalman filter and bootstrap particle filter) using the navigation observables extracted from the processed cellular SOP data. 
  * Summarized the project's findings into presentation slides and a poster presented to 50+ attendees (e.g. fellow interns, local university professors, and Air Force Research Lab (AFRL) researchers).
  * Debriefed 15+ AFRL researchers in the Navigation and Communication Branch (RYWN) on the project  insights and results.
